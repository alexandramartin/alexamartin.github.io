				<p>My name is Alexandra Martin as you can tell from the title. I'm a 15 year old girl who will turn 16 in August 20. I attend Lighthouse Community Charter High School. I love my siblings so much, their names are scotty and g-eazy. </p>
			<h2>Projects</h2>
					<p>One project I've worked on is making a robot dance to a specific song and on pace.</p>
					<p>Another project I've worked on is on object oriented programming where we duplicated an object and made move down the screen like snow.</p>
